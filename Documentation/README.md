At first glance we can see 3 folders:

1. Documentation
2. Front-End
3. Back-End

Here in the Documentation folder will be all the concepts and explanations of the system.

In the Front-End folder is the mobile app project and the backoffice project.

In the backend is the API and other programs that will be born.
